# # Power-law creep beside a viscosity
#
# A code that steps in time can let a relaxation time fall with stress:
# AdGIA divides it by 1 + gamma (|dev sigma| / 2 mu_0)^(n - 1), so that
# creep is linear at low stress and power-law at high. A model carries the
# two parameters a code needs, the stress exponent n and the transition
# stress sigma_t at which the two kinds of creep strain equally fast;
# gamma = (2 mu_0 / sigma_t)^(n - 1) follows.
#
# Needs: none
# Network: none
# Run: poetry run python examples/conversion/08_power_law.py
