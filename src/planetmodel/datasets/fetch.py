"""A data set's files, fetched once into a cache and checked every time.

`fetch(dataset)` gives the paths of a data set's files in its sources'
order (an archive's named members in place of the archive), from the
cache when they are there with the right sha256 and from the network
otherwise.  The cache is `PLANETMODEL_DATA` when it is set, else the
platform's per-user cache directory (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/planetmodel` or
`~/.cache/planetmodel`, `~/Library/Caches/planetmodel`,
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\\planetmodel\\Cache`), one directory per data set.

A download streams into a temporary file beside its final name, its
sha256 computed as it comes and its length checked against what the
server announced, and is renamed into place only when whole and right,
so that an interrupted download leaves nothing behind; the source's
mirrors are tried in turn.  Requests carry a timeout and a User-Agent
naming the library, URLs are percent-encoded, and certificates are
always checked: a source on a host whose certificate fails is reached
through a mirror, or its file is placed in the cache by hand, where
`fetch` finds it and checks its hash.  A hash that differs from the
entry's is refused, naming the file and both hashes, unless
`accept_changed=True`, which keeps the file and warns with its hash,
for a source that rewrites its files in place.  An archive's named
members are extracted beside it, each checked by `tarfile`'s data
filter or by its path to stay inside its directory, regular files only,
and re-extracted when the archive changes.  `download=False`, or
`PLANETMODEL_OFFLINE` set, keeps everything off the network.  The
standard library alone.
