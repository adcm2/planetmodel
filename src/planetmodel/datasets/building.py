"""Models built from data sets: a data set's perturbations on a model of one's own.

`transplanted(model, source)` is the steps of `datasets.processing` in
their order, for every name the source carries:

1. re-referenced (`rereferenced`): the source's perturbation kept, or
   under `mode="absolute"` its values against the model's own field; a
   data set of values made a perturbation of its own reference first,
   `source_reference` or, for a data set given by its entry, the
   reference the entry names;
2. its spherical mean at each radius removed when `remove_mean=True`
   (degree 0; on any field, no extra needed but for a resampling);
3. filtered by degree when `lmax=` (or `lmin=`) asks, rolled off over
   `roll_off` degrees;
4. spread onto whole layers (`ends=`, `extend=`, `taper=`, `layers=`);
5. attached by `perturbed`, so that a model type's own rules run: on an
   `Elastic` model a perturbed velocity re-derives the Love moduli.

A source name the model holds lands on itself; an isotropic name (`vs`,
`vp`) lands on the transversely isotropic pair the model holds where the
source does not carry that pair itself (`vs` on `vsv` and `vsh`, as
SPECFEM applies S40RTS to PREM), and is otherwise left out; `names=`
maps each source name to the model's names explicitly.  Conversions,
velocity-to-density scalings among them, are not made here.  The model
cites what it cited and then what the source does.

Strata (`datasets.strata`) go onto a model by one of two routes
(`ROUTES`).  **As geometry**, chosen interfaces of the model move to
chosen surfaces of the strata (`interfaces`, each model interface to an
index into `Strata.surfaces`, a stratum's name for its top, or one of
the surfaces itself, deeper interfaces to deeper surfaces): each
interface's shift is its `relief`, the surface's radius in the model's
units less the interface's, held on the surfaces' grid, and the model is
stretched by `layer_linear` over exactly these reliefs, every other
boundary staying spherical.  `reliefs` gives the shifts alone, keyed as
asked, for a boundary-perturbation method that takes them rather than a
deformed model.  A layer of the model taken to zero or negative
thickness anywhere on the grid is refused, so a stratum that thins to
nothing is merged with its neighbours into one layer, never a layer of
its own.  The one model layer between two moved interfaces holds the
strata between their surfaces, merged: each property the
thickness-weighted mean over them (`take` names a stratum whose own
values a layer holds instead), varying with the angles and constant in
radius, exact on the grid.  **As fields**, the skeleton stays
spherical, and each point of the chosen layers (by default those the
strata reach) takes the property of the stratum its radius falls in,
linear in radius within it, `Strata.below` beneath the last surface
where it holds the property and the model's own field elsewhere,
sampled on the grid at radial elements `spacing` apart: smeared across
the strata's surfaces by nature.  A property lands on the names the
layer holds as a source name does (`vp` on `vpv` and `vph`), or as
`properties` maps it, in the model's units; on an `Elastic` model the
moduli follow.  Either way the model cites the strata after its own.
