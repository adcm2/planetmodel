"""The Woodhouse-Ritsema coefficient files: spherical harmonics on radial splines.

S20RTS, S40RTS, S12RTS and SP12RTS are distributed as `.sph` files.  The
first line is the header, `lmax degree-mask nslot slot-mask`, the masks
one digit (1 present, 0 absent) per degree 0 ... lmax and per slot; then,
for each present slot in order and each present degree l = 0 ... lmax,
the 2l + 1 coefficients a_l0, a_l1, b_l1, ..., a_ll, b_ll, each degree
starting a line.  A first line holding lmax alone means every degree and
slot is present, and a file of numbers alone (SGLOBE-rani's copies) is
read with `lmax=` given, its blocks taken as the mantle's splines.  The
24 slots are three of the crust, absent from these files, and the 21
radial splines of the mantle, from the Moho down to the CMB.

The model is

    f(r, theta, phi) = sum_k S_k(x) sum_lm X_lm(theta)
                                      (a_klm cos(m phi) + b_klm sin(m phi)),

with X_lm the complex orthonormal Legendre functions carrying the
Condon-Shortley phase and no sqrt 2 (`"woodhouse"` with `csphase=-1` in
`planetmodel.harmonics`), x = -1 + 2 (r - r_cmb) / (r_moho - r_cmb), and
S_k the cardinal cubic spline of knot k of `SPLINE_KNOTS`: the cubic
spline through one at that knot and zero at the others, clamped at each
end to the slope of the quadratic through the three end knots, C2
between, as Woodhouse's `rspln` builds it.  Being piecewise cubic in r
it is held exactly, and `sph_field` is a `HarmonicField` on [r_cmb,
r_moho], the perturbation zero beyond.  The values are fractions, dlnVs
(or dlnVp for SP12RTS's P part), degree 0 kept as the file holds it.
`SPH_RADII` are the CMB and Moho of these models in metres, 3480 and
6346.6 km (6346.619 km in Ritsema's own code, 19 m higher).

`SphReader(parameters)` reads a data set of such files, one name per
file (`vs`, `vp`), into the model `models.over_reference` makes over the
entry's reference.
