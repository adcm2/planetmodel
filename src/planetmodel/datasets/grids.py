"""Gridded sources: netCDF grids of latitude and longitude, in the library's form.

The Earth Model Collaboration's files, and COARDS grids such as GMT's,
hold fields on a grid of latitude and longitude, with or without a
vertical axis, in conventions that vary from file to file.  `read_grid`
reads one into a `GridData` in the library's form:

- the axes are found by their coordinate variables' names (latitude,
  lat; longitude, lon; x and y; depth; radius; elevation, height), or
  failing those by `standard_name`, units and `positive`, in any order
  of dimensions;
- a vertical axis of depth (positive down), radius or elevation becomes
  radius in metres on the source's surface radius (its global
  `radius_in_meters`, else `surface=`, the Earth's 6371 km by default),
  increasing; two slices within `VERTICAL_RTOL` of the surface radius of
  each other, and the pairs `pairs=` names, are made one radius: a
  discontinuity, the two slices its sides, as a repeated radius is in a
  deck;
- latitudes become colatitudes increasing from the north, longitudes
  are reduced into one turn and sorted, a seam column repeated at the
  end made one with the first; equally spaced nodes are
  snapped to their exact positions, and `regular=True` rebuilds a
  glitched coordinate as the regular one of its count and ends, refused
  where a node is off by more than half a step;
- missing values (`_FillValue`, `missing_value`, NaN) become NaN, and
  `valid_range` is ignored, being in some files the rounded range of
  the data;
- a seam column repeated at the end, and a pole row, are checked to hold
  one value to `SAME_RTOL` of the field's largest (the precision of a file
  written to five figures) and made exactly that; one that does not is
  refused, or averaged where the entry says so (`seam="mean"`,
  `pole_rows="mean"`: a source whose own gridding left two columns on
  one meridian);
- `stride=k` keeps every k-th latitude and longitude of the file's own
  order, for a grid too fine to hold whole, and `vertical=(lo, hi)` the
  slices whose vertical coordinate lies in that window (in the file's
  own units, either end open as None), for a source whose part beyond it
  is not wanted; both are applied as the file is read, and the file's
  own precision kept until the grid is in its order, so that a large
  grid is copied only once it is cut down.

`read_table` reads a text table of longitude, latitude and values, a
node a row in any order (LithoRef18's), into the same form: the rows
must be every node of a product of latitudes and longitudes, each once,
and the coordinates then follow the rules above.

A grid on a projected plane, x and y (a polar stereographic grid of the
Antarctic, EPSG:3031), is read as `ProjectedData`: its northing and
easting in metres, increasing (their unit a length, km or m), its values
on (radius, y, x), and the projection, `projection=` where the entry
gives it and else the file's `proj4text`
(`projections.PolarStereographic`); it is always regional.

A grid whose longitudes go round the circle and whose latitudes reach
within a step and a half of each pole is global, on an `AngularGrid`:
the shipped equiangular kind where its nodes are one (from wherever its
longitudes start), a custom grid otherwise.  Any other is regional,
kept on its own coordinates.  Values stay in the file's units, beside
its unit strings.

`grid_model` makes the model of a global grid with a vertical axis:
each variable under the vocabulary name it is mapped to, in SI by its
unit string (`units.parse_unit`; a mislabel corrected by `units=`), as
values (kind None) or as a perturbation of one of `perturbation.KINDS`
over a reference; depth slices missing everywhere dropped from the ends
of the support and refused inside it, scattered missing values refused
unless `fill=` gives them; `GriddedField`s with `ngll = 2` between the
slices, radially linear, laterally `lateral` (linear by default), one
per segment between discontinuities; at a pole the grid lacks, the mean
of its nearest ring, the reader's rule, right to second order in the
ring's distance from the pole.  `RegionalGrid` holds a regional grid's
values in SI and evaluates them inside its box.  `GridReader` is the
reader of a data set of one such file: a model of a global grid, a
`RegionalGrid` of a regional one.  netCDF4 is imported where a file is
read (the `netcdf` extra).
