"""The shipped data sets, each entry written once, and the lookup by name.

`REGISTRY` maps each shipped entry's name to it, read-only; a caller's
own `Dataset` is used exactly as a shipped one, passed where a name
would go (`DatasetLike`).  Each entry states what its source states: the
original host first (mirrors after it), the sha256 of the file as
published, the licence in the source's own words, and every work the
source asks to be cited.  `describe` and `cite` give that text.
