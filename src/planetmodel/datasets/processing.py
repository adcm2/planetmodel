"""Processing: a data set's fields made fit for a model of one's own.

A data set's perturbations are put onto a model of one's own in steps,
each a function of fields and models, so that every step can be looked
at and replaced.

`rereferenced(source, onto)` gives, for each name, a `Perturbation`: a
kind and the fields that tile the source's support.  Under
`mode="relative"`, the usual practice, the source's own perturbation is
kept as it is (a data set of values made a perturbation of its own
reference first, `source_reference`); under `mode="absolute"` the
source's values are kept, so that the perturbation is relative to
`onto`'s field (v / R_onto - 1 for a relative kind, log(v / R_onto) for
a log one, v - R_onto for an absolute one), and where the two references
differ, at a discontinuity of one the other lacks, the result shows it,
split at `onto`'s boundaries inside the support.  A reference holding a
transversely isotropic pair where the name is isotropic gives its Voigt
average.

`spread(perturbation, onto)` puts one onto whole layers of `onto`, a
field per layer: as it lies by radius, refusing a layer it covers in
part and naming the remedies, which are `ends=(inner, outer)` (the
support mapped affinely onto the radii between two of `onto`'s
interfaces), `extend=True` (the end values continued to the ends of the
layers covered in part) and `taper=` (a width, or a bottom and a top
one, over which the perturbation goes to zero inside each end of its
support, by `raised_cosine`, and zero beyond).  A layer that one
segment covers as it lies, untapered, keeps the segment's own field, a
harmonic field harmonic.

`filtered(field, lmax=)` weights a field by degree: coefficients cut
above `lmax` and below `lmin`, or rolled off by the raised cosine over
`roll_off` degrees below `lmax`.  A harmonic field gives a harmonic
field; a gridded field on a grid of a shipped kind is analysed at each
node, weighted and synthesised back onto its own grid or `grid=`; a
perturbed field is filtered in its perturbation;
a field composed from a gridded one (a data set of values made relative
to a reference) is first sampled onto that field's grid and radial
nodes (`resampled`).  `demeaned` is a field less its spherical mean at
each radius, exact for a harmonic field (its degree 0 gone) and for a
gridded one (the mean of its lateral rule taken at every node).

`merged(model, regional, name=)` blends a `RegionalGrid` into the
field `name` of a model, both expressed relative to the model's own
reference (a regional grid of values made a perturbation of it):
f = g + w (r - g) with w the raised cosine of the great-circle distance
inside the region's edge over `width` (an angle), and of radius over
`radial_width` inside its depth ends (zero for a sharp end, as at the
surface), w zero where the regional grid has no value; on each layer
the region reaches, a `GriddedField` on `grid` between the regional
grid's slices, its poles evaluated, attached through `with_field`, so
that a model type's own rules run.  The result is the global field
resampled on `grid` outside the region, equal to it at the grid's nodes;
a layer whose reference vanishes (a fluid's shear velocity) is left as
it is.

`raised_cosine` is the one taper all of them use.
