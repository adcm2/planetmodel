"""Linear viscoelastic rheologies, and a model frozen at one frequency.

A linear viscoelastic body at angular frequency omega is an elastic body
with complex moduli, so a solver written for the moduli A, C, F, L, N
serves any linear rheology once the model is frozen at a frequency.
What a layer's rheology is, is read from the fields it holds, in the
manner of `is_fluid` and `moduli`:

- `viscosity`: a Maxwell body in shear,
  mu(omega) = mu i omega tau / (1 + i omega tau) with tau = viscosity / mu,
  mu being the Voigt-averaged shear modulus;
- Prony branches, `relaxation_strength_k` and `relaxation_time_k` for k
  = 1, 2, ... (`vocabulary.FAMILIES`): a generalised Maxwell body in
  shear, mu(omega) = mu [1 - sum_k w_k / (1 + i omega tau_k)], the
  relaxed part (1 - sum w_k) mu, of which the viscosity is the one-branch
  case (w_1 = 1, tau_1 = viscosity / mu), so a layer holding both is
  refused, as is a branch without its partner or a gap in the indices
  (`branches`);
- `qmu`, `qkappa`: a constant-Q absorption band about the reference
  frequency omega_0,
  mu(omega) = mu [1 + (2 / pi Q_mu) ln(omega / omega_0) + i / Q_mu],
  and likewise kappa with Q_kappa; a non-positive Q means no loss.

A transversely isotropic layer is perturbed through its Voigt averages:
with delta kappa = (f_kappa - 1) kappa and delta mu = (f_mu - 1) mu,
A and C gain delta kappa + 4 delta mu / 3, F gains
delta kappa - 2 delta mu / 3, and L and N gain delta mu, which is the
isotropic rule when the layer is isotropic and leaves the anisotropy
real.  A layer holding both a viscosity (or branches) and Q_mu is a
Maxwell body in shear (the shear band is not applied on top) with the
bulk band; a layer holding none of them is elastic and left alone.
`is_rheology_name` says which names a layer's rheology is read from.

`frozen(model, omega, *, reference_omega=None)` returns the model with
the complex moduli of every viscoelastic layer stored under A, C, F, L,
N, which `moduli` reads before anything else, and the frequency
recorded as the constant `omega`.  Frequencies are in the model's
units; the reference frequency of the band is the model's constant
`omega_ref` where it declares one, else 2 pi rad/s, a period of one
second, which is PREM's (`reference_omega`).  `is_frozen(model)` says
whether a model carries that constant.  The velocities of a frozen
layer, and kappa and mu where it holds them, stay as the elastic
description at the reference frequency; the five are what a solver
reads.
