"""A radial reference with a perturbation: a kind of field, not two names.

A laterally varying model is often stated as a one-dimensional
reference and a perturbation of it, a tomographic model as relative
perturbations of a reference's velocities, a viscosity as the logarithm
of its departure from a radial profile.  `PerturbedField(reference,
perturbation, *, kind)` is such a field, and the kind is how the two
combine:

    absolute   reference + perturbation
    relative   reference (1 + perturbation)
    log        reference exp(perturbation), the natural logarithm

The reference is a radial field of rank 0; the perturbation is a field
of rank 0 on the same interval, of the reference's character when it is
absolute and dimensionless (`SCALAR`) otherwise.  The field has the
reference's character and is radial exactly when the perturbation is.
`reference`, `perturbation` and `kind` are attributes, so that a writer
of files and a spherical mean ask the field for them rather than a
central module inspecting types.  Under a change of units the reference
rescales by its dimensions and the perturbation by them only when it is
absolute: a relative or logarithmic perturbation is a pure number.

`perturbed(model, name, perturbation, *, kind)` wraps the field of that
name on every layer the perturbation's interval covers, restating the
perturbation on each by `on_interval`, so that one perturbation over the
whole mantle perturbs each of its layers; a layer covered only in part
is refused by name.  It goes through `with_field(replace=True)`, so a
model type's own rule runs: on an `Elastic` model a perturbed velocity
re-derives the Love moduli from it.  `unperturbed(model)` puts every
perturbed field's reference back the same way.  A fully 3D field is
simply a field that is not perturbed; the reference and the spherical
mean of a perturbed field differ in general and are named apart.
