"""Values between the nodes of an angular grid: the lateral rules.

A field that varies with direction is stored at the nodes of an
`AngularGrid` and read between them by one of three rules, the same
here and in every reader of the library's files:

    linear     bilinear in (theta, phi) on the padded grid
    cubic      the tensor-product cubic spline on the padded grid,
               periodic in longitude and clamped at the poles
    harmonic   analysis on the grid and synthesis at the point, exact
               for a field band-limited to the grid's band (to the
               accuracy of `harmonics.synthesise`); only on a grid of a
               shipped kind with a band

**The padded grid.**  The local rules are rules on a rectangle of
(theta, phi), so the sphere is first laid out as one.  The longitudes
phi_0 < ... < phi_{n-1} gain the wrap column phi_0 + 2 pi, a copy of the
first, and the colatitudes gain a row at each pole the grid lacks as a
node, holding the field's value at that pole across every column; a
pole that is a node keeps its own row.  A point is read at its
colatitude, which must lie in [0, pi], and at its longitude reduced
into [phi_0, phi_0 + 2 pi).  The bilinear rule is the tensor-product
spline of degree one on that grid.  The bicubic rule is the
tensor-product cubic spline on it with these end conditions:

- in longitude, periodic, so that the interpolant and its first two
  derivatives are continuous across the seam at phi_0;
- in colatitude, clamped at each pole to a slope s(phi) = a cos phi +
  b sin phi, with (a, b) fitted by least squares, over the grid's
  longitudes, to the slopes that the not-a-knot spline through each
  meridian's values has at that pole.  A function with a gradient at a
  pole has exactly such slopes leaving it, the gradient's two
  components; with them the interpolant has a gradient there too, to
  the accuracy of the spline in longitude between the grid's columns.

Both local rules interpolate the nodes and the polar values, and both
are linear in the values, the bicubic one through the fitted slopes as
well.

**The polar values** have one source each.  A pole that is a node of
the grid is its own row, which must hold one value, constant along the
longitudes to `rtol` of the values' largest: a row that varies there
describes no field, and making it single-valued is for whoever read
the data.  A pole the grid lacks takes its value from `poles` (north
then south), as a model file stores it, evaluated exactly by the
writer; `poles` always has both entries, the one for a pole that is a
node either agreeing with its row or NaN, meaning not given.  Without
`poles`, a grid of a shipped kind takes the values from its own
expansion, those of the field band-limited to the grid, and any other
grid lacking a pole is refused, so that no polar value is ever guessed.
`polar_values` is that rule.  A scalar has one value at a pole; a
field with components is interpolated component by component in the
Cartesian frame, where it too is single-valued at a pole, and the
rotation into that frame belongs to the field, not to this module.
The harmonic rule's expansion defines its own values at the poles, so
it checks `poles` like any rule but does not use them.

**Accuracy.**  A local rule wants an oversampled grid.  For a field of
band 16 with coefficients falling as 1/(l + 1), on Gauss-Legendre
grids, the largest error relative to the field's largest value is
about 0.09 for the bicubic rule at the field's own band, 2e-4 at four
times it and 1e-5 at eight, and 0.3, 2e-2 and 5e-3 for the bilinear
one: fourth order against second (the cases of
`tests/test_lateral.py`).  Analysis on an oversampled grid is still
exact to the field's band, so a grid of about four times the band
serves a local reader and a spectral one alike.  The bicubic rule is
continuously differentiable everywhere, so a relief read by it gives a
mapping whose deformation gradient is single-valued on the polar axis
and on the seam; its second derivatives may jump at a pole.

`LateralInterpolant` builds a rule once over any array whose two
trailing axes are a grid's, and gives its values and its two angular
derivatives at any points, and its mean over the sphere: exactly, the
mean of the interpolant itself, so that a mean is consistent with the
rule that reads the values (for the local rules the coefficients
against the integrals of the B-splines, sin(theta) dtheta and dphi; for
the harmonic rule the degree-zero term); `interpolate` builds one and
evaluates it.
Everything is numbers.
