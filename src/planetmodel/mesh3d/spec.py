"""What to mesh, and what came back.

A MeshSpec is the whole description of a wanted mesh: the geometry, the
sizing of every interface, the shells appended outside the geometry,
the dimension and element order, and what the mapping may do to the
outer boundary.  The mesh built from it is always the reference one;
the mapping is applied at the MFEM export.  The computational
domain is the geometry's layers followed by the shells, numbered from
the centre; `MeshSpec.domain` is that domain as a Geometry under the
geometry's own mapping, and is what the builder meshes.

Sizing is a callable, not a class hierarchy: a rule takes the
interfaces of the computational domain and its outer radius, in the
geometry's own lengths, and returns one InterfaceSizing per interface
index.  The shipped rules are frozen dataclasses whose instances
are the callable, so they print, compare and serialise; anything else
is a function.  A refinement is a second kind of callable, a size
field over the reference domain composed into the sizing by minimum,
so it can only refine, never coarsen; NearPoints and near_curve are
the shipped kinds, and anything with the Refinement protocol's two
attributes serves.

Nothing here knows about units.  Every length is a number in the
geometry's own lengths, and the builder hands those numbers to gmsh
unchanged: a geometry of radius 6.4e6 is meshed at radius 6.4e6.
