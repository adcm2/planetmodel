"""Conversions: seismic fields into thermal and rheological ones.

The laws that turn a model's seismic structure into what a solver of
slow deformation reads (a temperature anomaly from a velocity anomaly, a
density from either, a viscosity from them) are written on numbers in
SI (`laws`), each a short function a reader can hold against its
source; the parameters that vary with radius are profiles (`profiles`);
and a law's values travel with their sources as a parameter set
(`parameters`), so that whatever is built with one cites it.  Applied
to a model (`building`), a law reads an anomaly from the model's fields
and writes what it makes as lazy fields: a viscosity as a log
perturbation of the layer's radial one, a density as a relative
perturbation of its reference.  A viscosity becomes Prony branches
(`prony`): a Maxwell, Burgers or fitted Andrade body put on a model as
the strengths and times `rheology` reads.  A table of properties against
temperature and pressure, written by an offline generator, gives a
temperature anomaly by inversion (`tables`).  The base of the
lithosphere is found in a model's fields, at an isotherm, a viscosity
or a Maxwell time (`lithosphere`), and used as geometry
(`datasets.building.moved`) or as a lid of high viscosity.  Nothing
here is particular to the Earth.

Reached through its modules, off the top-level surface, with numpy and
scipy alone:
